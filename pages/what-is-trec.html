                <p><h2 id="part-1">Exploring the Chemical Diversity of Rocky Exoplanets</h2> <BR>
                    &emsp; The TREC (Tracing Rocky Exoplanet Compositions) project focuses on understanding the chemical compositions of rocky exoplanets, particularly their surfaces, and the impact of these variations on climate, habitability, and the potential for life detection. Our team is dedicated to addressing the fundamental questions: What is the range of chemical compositions on rocky exoplanets? and Which chemical variations are most crucial for climate, habitability, and life detection?
                    <br>
                    &emsp; To tackle these questions, TREC is implementing a comprehensive research program. This initiative aims to determine the initial chemical compositions of stellar systems and trace the changes that occur during the formation and evolution of planets. From the protoplanetary disk to mantle-surface interactions over geological time, our work will synthesize these findings to establish statistical distributions of surface abundances of key elements that influence climate, habitability, and life detection.

                    <h2 id="part-2">Research Focus </h2><br>
                    &emsp; Our research is structured into five core tasks:
                    <li>
                    Stellar Compositions and Age Refinement <br>
                    &emsp;We will enhance existing catalogs by measuring key elemental abundances in Sun-like stars, focusing on rarely measured elements such as phosphorus (P), thorium (Th), and uranium (U). We aim to refine the stellar ages of these stars with a precision of less than 1 Gyr and test whether variations among solar twins are due to planetary material accretion.
                </li> <li>
                    Compositional Changes in Protoplanetary Disks <br>
                    &emsp;We will investigate the changes in planetary materials resulting from radial pebble fluxes and condensation fronts within protoplanetary disks, testing these models using meteoritic data.
                </li><li>
                    Mantle Composition and Differentiation <br>
                    &emsp;Our work will explore how elements are sequestered into planetary cores, removing them from surface interaction. We will compile metal-silicate partition coefficients, model mantle mineralogy post-magma ocean crystallization, and assess the impact of giant collisions.
                </li><li>
                    Mantle Evolution and Surface Processes <br>
                    &emsp;We will study how mantle compositions evolve, focusing on how melts interact with planetary surfaces, outgassing volatiles, and forming crusts. This task involves advanced thermodynamic and geodynamic modeling to simulate heat flux decline over time.
                </li><li>
                    Synthesis and Community Engagement <br>
                    &emsp;We will synthesize our findings to map the likely range of rocky exoplanet mantle and surface compositions as functions of age, mass, and stellar abundances. Through workshops and community consensus-building, we aim to identify which elemental abundance variations are most critical for climate, habitability, and life detection on exoplanets.

                    <h2 id="part-3">Importance of Our Work </h2><br>
                    &emsp;The search for life on exoplanets is one of the grand challenges of modern science. NASA has developed a comprehensive plan to guide this search, with key missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) already providing valuable data, such as the detection of atmospheric CO2 on WASP-39b. Our research directly supports these efforts by providing the necessary geochemical context to interpret potential biosignatures, such as oxygen, which is considered a key indicator of life.

                <h2>Objectives and Significance of Our Research</h2>
                <h3>The Importance of Chemical Inventory in the Search for Life on Exoplanets</h3>
                <p>The discovery of Earth-like exoplanets has become increasingly frequent, yet the field of exoplanetary science remains in its formative stages, similar to planetary science several decades ago. In the 1960s, Venus was believed to potentially support liquid water, based solely on its mass and radius. However, subsequent robotic missions revealed its stark chemical differences from Earth, fundamentally altering our understanding of its climate and habitability. <br>

                    Recent advancements, such as the JWST's detection of atmospheric CO2 on WASP-39b and anticipated findings in the Trappist-1 system, are shifting the focus away from mass, radius, and temperature as primary indicators of Earth-like conditions. Instead, the composition and geochemical cycles of these planets are gaining recognition for their critical role in determining habitability. <br> 
                    
                    Our team, part of the Nexus for Exoplanetary System Science (NExSS) from 2015 to 2021, was dedicated to bridging geology and planetary science with astronomical observations of exoplanets. A key achievement of our research was highlighting the significance of a planet’s surface water content in using oxygen as a biosignature. Detecting O2 or O3 in a rocky exoplanet’s atmosphere is a major goal in exoplanet science, given that Earth's 21% O2 atmosphere is a direct result of global photosynthesis. <br>
                    
                    However, our findings suggest that the presence of oxygen alone is not a definitive biosignature. Instead, it is the rate of O2 production that holds significance. On Earth, this rate far exceeds abiotic processes, making it a reliable indicator of life. However, on planets with vastly different conditions, such as those with more surface water, the geochemical cycling of essential elements like phosphorus could limit oxygen production to levels that are indistinguishable from abiotic sources.<br>
                    
                    Our research has provided valuable insights into target selection strategies and the interpretation of future data. While life requires water, our findings suggest that rocky exoplanets with excessive surface water should be deprioritized when searching for biosignatures, even if oxygen is detected.<br> </p>
                    
                    <h3>Investigating Chemical Compositions of Rocky Exoplanets</h3>
                    <p>The chemical composition of rocky exoplanets, particularly their surfaces, plays a crucial role in their climate, habitability, and the potential detection of life. The ASU-NExSS team has explored how variations in planetary composition, especially in elements like magnesium, silicon, and phosphorus, can lead to dramatically different outcomes for planets that might otherwise seem similar. <br>
                    
                    For instance, differences in mantle composition, influenced by factors such as the Mg/Si ratio, can affect surface recycling, volcanic activity, and overall planetary behavior. Additionally, processes like planetary differentiation, giant impacts, and mantle degassing can further alter the surface composition of these planets, influencing the availability of bioessential elements.<br>
                    
                    Understanding these variations is essential for assessing geophysical cycles and detecting potential biosignatures. However, this task is complex, as it requires detailed knowledge of the abundances of key elements on exoplanet surfaces and their interiors. For example, phosphorus, a limiting nutrient in primary production, varies significantly across planets and can influence the net production of oxygen, a potential biosignature.<br>
                    
                    Our research emphasizes the need for a comprehensive chemical inventory of exoplanet surfaces and interiors as a foundational step toward understanding their geophysical cycles and potential habitability. This approach will enable more accurate assessments of climate, habitability, and the potential for life on rocky exoplanets.<br>

                <h2>(Coming back to format this later) Research Objectives and Expected Significance</h2>
                <p>
                    Setting the Stage for Modeling Geochemical Cycles on Exoplanets
                    
                    Our research is centered around two primary objectives that will lay the foundation for modeling geochemical cycles on rocky exoplanets.
                    
                    Objective 1: Quantifying Statistical Distributions of Elemental Partitioning Our first objective focuses on quantifying how key elements partition between stars, disks, planets, cores, mantles, and surfaces over time. Understanding these distributions is essential for predicting the likely ranges of compositions on rocky exoplanets, which directly influences their climate, habitability, and the potential detection of life.
                    
                    To achieve this objective, we will undertake the following tasks:
                    
                    Task 1: Compile and augment stellar abundances, with a particular emphasis on phosphorus (P), and refine stellar ages with a precision of less than 1 Gyr. We will also investigate the causes of abundance variations among solar twins.
                    
                    Task 2: Quantify chemical changes in planetary materials during the protoplanetary disk stage, focusing on radial pebble fluxes and condensation fronts.
                    
                    Task 3: Model the segregation of species during core formation, utilizing both compiled data and newly calculated partition coefficients. This task includes modeling magma ocean crystallization and assessing the impact of giant impacts on bulk compositions. We will benchmark these models against the planets of our Solar System.
                    
                    Task 4: Experimentally derive new data on melting curves and phosphorus solubilities in exoplanet upper mantles across a range of compositions. We will model the rates at which mantles chemically communicate with surfaces over time due to melt production, volcanism, and outgassing. Each process will be statistically analyzed to determine the final distributions of core, mantle, and surface compositions.
                    
                    Objective 2: Identifying Critical Elemental Variations Our second objective is to identify which elemental variations significantly impact exoplanetary properties such as climate, habitability, and biosignatures. We aim to understand the physical processes responsible for these variations, which will guide future research and tie these properties to other observable characteristics of stellar systems.
                    
                    For example, while the abundance of zinc (Zn) may vary widely, its influence on climate and habitability is likely minimal. Conversely, even a modest increase in surface water (H₂O) can have profound effects, such as submerging continents, suppressing weathering rates, and altering climate and oxygen-based biosignatures.
                    
                    Task 5: Convening Workshops to Advance Research** Given the complexity of modeling geochemical cycles on exoplanets, our fifth task involves convening workshops to engage with the NExSS and astrobiology communities. In Year 2, we will gather and publish insights on which elemental variations are most relevant to climate, habitability, and life detection. A second workshop in Year 5 will focus on communicating our predicted compositional ranges and their implications for observational strategies and future research.
                    
                    Engaging the Scientific Community
                    
                    Our research extends beyond theoretical modeling and data collection. We aim to facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration and advance the field of exoplanetary science through the following actions:
                    
                    Collecting and Publishing New Data: We will perform petrology experiments to determine melting curves and solubilities for non-Earthlike exoplanet compositions. Additionally, we will calculate new metal-silicate partition coefficients, update the Hypatia stellar abundances catalog, and refine the ages of hundreds of star systems, contributing to the Celestia and Habitable Zone Gallery databases.
                    
                    Developing Sophisticated Models: Our team will develop an array of models focused on chemical fractionations during molecular cloud core collapse, disk processes, core formation, magma ocean crystallization, and giant impacts. These models will be benchmarked against Solar System planets, leveraging exoplanet research to enhance our understanding of planetary science.
                    
                    Organizing Workshops: We will organize two workshops to develop consensus on the ranges of compositions that matter for broader issues such as climate, habitability, and biosignatures. These workshops will also facilitate transdisciplinary research and communicate best practices.
                    
                    Coordinating Research within NExSS: We will promote interdisciplinary research by hosting virtual presentations and participating in steering committees and the Science Communication Working Group.
                    
                    Sharing New Tools: Our model codes and databases, including those for partition coefficients and mantle rheologies, will be made publicly available through the ENKI platform. These open-source tools, accessible via Jupyter notebooks, will benefit the broader exoplanet and Earth science communities.
                    
                    Engaging with the Astronomical Community: We will contribute to White Papers and strategy documents to ensure that our results inform target selection, mission design, and the interpretation of future observations.
                    
                    Training the Next Generation of Scientists: By involving undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in our research, we will foster the development of interdisciplinary scientists who can work seamlessly across fields.
                    
                    Integrating Our Research with NExSS and Beyond
                    
                    Our integrated and interdisciplinary research program bridges astronomy, Earth science, and planetary science. By tracing rocky exoplanet compositions through star and planet formation, disk processes, and planetary interior processes, we aim to inform the contextualization of JWST exoplanet atmospheric transmission spectra and the design of future space telescopes like HabEx and LUVOIR.
                    
                    Our research aligns with the goals of the NExSS Research Coordination Network, specifically addressing the emphasis on habitability and the detection of life on exoplanets. It also supports two of the six major research goals of the Astrobiology Program as outlined in the 2015 Astrobiology Strategy Document: identifying and characterizing environments for habitability and biosignatures, and constructing habitable worlds.

                <p>Task 1: From Clouds to Stars and Disks
                    Task Lead: Young
                    
                    Planets form in protoplanetary disks alongside their stars, originating from molecular clouds whose compositions are influenced by Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. Understanding these compositions is crucial as they serve as the starting point for planetary systems. We aim to expand our catalog of elemental abundances for Sun-like stars and refine stellar ages, which will provide insights into the GCE and planetary evolution. Additionally, we will investigate whether compositional variations among solar twins are due to non-accretion of planetary material or magnetic effects during star formation.
                    
                    Task 1a: Stellar Abundances
                    Leads: Hinkel, Young, Maas
                    
                    We will determine the bulk abundances of Sun-like stars, focusing on key elements such as Fe, Mg, Si, and others, using both optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic data. Our sample includes 229 Sun-like stars, 36 of which are confirmed exoplanet hosts. By combining new observations with archival data, we will enhance the Hypatia Catalog, the most comprehensive database of stellar abundances near the Sun. This work will involve comparing observed abundances with GCE model predictions.
                    
                    Task 1b: Stellar Ages
                    Lead: Young
                    
                    To accurately compare elemental abundances with GCE model predictions, we need precise stellar ages (~±1 Gyr). We will refine the ages of our sample stars by improving isochronal age estimates using updated stellar parameters. This will involve comparing stars against Tycho stellar evolution models and incorporating various methods like gyrochronology and chromospheric activity. Our goal is to achieve age uncertainties comparable to those obtained using gyrochronology, even for late G and early K stars.
                    
                    Task 1c: Chemical Fractionations During Star Formation
                    Leads: Desch, Unterborn
                    
                    We will test whether chemical fractionations occur during star formation, which could explain observed compositional differences among solar twins. Using models that incorporate magnetic field effects and dust grain retention, we will predict trends in elemental depletions and compare them with observational data. This work will help us understand the impact of magnetic fields on the chemical evolution of stellar systems. </p>

                        Planets that form at different distances (r) from a star are expected to originate from the solids that condensed from a protoplanetary disk, reflecting the same composition as the disk and star (as outlined in Task 1a). However, two processes—condensation fronts and the pebble nature of solids—alter the compositions of planetary materials. Just outside the maximum r at which H₂O exists as vapor, the 'cold-finger' effect may cause the ice/rock ratio to exceed the system-wide average by an order of magnitude. Additionally, there is growing recognition (e.g., Ormel, 2017) that solids in disks exist as 'pebbles' that are slightly decoupled aerodynamically from the gas, allowing rapid planet growth by 'pebble accretion' and leading to large inward radial drifts of volatile-rich solids, altering compositions in planet-forming regions. Pebbles may undergo devolatilization during planetary accretion. In Task 2, we quantify how these effects shift the distributions of chemical compositions of planets relative to their host stars as they form from disks.

                        Task 2a. Fractionations Due to Condensation Fronts (Desch, ASU Graduate Student, Unterborn)
                        How do condensation fronts radially redistribute elements within protoplanetary disks?
                        It has long been recognized (Lunine & Stevenson, 1988; Ciesla & Cuzzi, 2006) that volatiles like water can be redistributed within evolving disks due to condensation fronts or 'snow lines.' Ice-bearing particles may drift inward relative to the gas to warmer regions where temperatures exceed the condensation temperature (T > TCOND ≈ 170 K), leading to ice vaporization. The H₂O vapor can then diffuse outward relative to the gas to colder regions (T < TCOND), where it freezes and accumulates as ice. For typical rates of particle drift and vapor diffusion, the O/Si (H₂O ice/dust) ratio is enhanced above cosmic abundances by factors of ~3 in a zone ~0.1 AU wide beyond the condensation front, while the O/Si (H₂O vapor/dust) ratio is depleted inside it (Cuzzi & Zahnle, 2004). Different elements have different TCOND, and they can be similarly fractionated by condensation fronts, with chemical consequences assessable using meteoritic and planetary data. Redistribution of H₂O has long been thought to change the oxygen fugacity (fO₂) of planetary materials in the Sun's protoplanetary disk: enstatite chondrites formed inside the H₂O snow line have fO₂ roughly 5 log units below the iron-wüstite buffer (ΔIW ≈ -5), while carbonaceous chondrites formed outside it are oxidized, with ΔIW ≈ 0 (e.g., Lin, 2022). More recently, vaporization of silicates and recondensation of forsterite (Mg₂SiO₄) near 'rock lines' has been recognized to vary Mg/Si ratios in the solar nebula (Aguichine et al., 2020). Similarly, Mane et al. (2021) proposed that Ca-rich, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) formed in a region of enhanced solids/gas ratio and Ca/Si and Al/Si ratios due to vaporization and recondensation of refractory minerals at a 'CAI snow line.' In the same hypothesis, they proposed CAIs experienced low fO₂, requiring an influx of C-rich pebbles. Lehner et al. (2013) proposed that evaporation of sulfur and recondensation of FeS at a 'sulfur snow line' created a region of enhanced sulfur fugacity and S/Si ratio where enstatite chondrites formed. If condensation fronts work as hypothesized, planetary materials can form in disk regions with large (~3×) variations in the proportions of key elements.
                        
                        Co-I Desch and an ASU graduate student will assess the extent to which elemental fractionations occur at snow lines in protoplanetary disks through a suite of simulations modeling condensation fronts associated with CAI-forming minerals, forsterite, major silicates, and FeS and other sulfur-bearing species. We will use underlying disk models from the literature, including but not limited to the detailed model of Desch et al. (2018), which describes the redistribution of CAIs in the solar nebula. We will use the associated code (Kalyaan, 2018) to model vaporization and transport of particles and vapors in such modeled protoplanetary disks. PI Desch will supervise an ASU graduate student to modify these codes to include limited chemical networks to simulate vaporization and condensation of relevant species. We will use the ArCCoS code (Unterborn & Panero, 2017) to create lookup tables across the range of relevant P-T-X values, allowing us to partition key elements between vapor and solids at each location in the disk. We will use these modified versions of the disk code to simulate different condensation fronts and test the following hypotheses against Solar System meteoritic and planetary data: Did CAIs form at a condensation front, and can they probe the carbon pebble flux in the solar nebula? Did a condensation front associated with forsterite alter the Mg/Si ratio across the disk? Did a sulfur snow line exist and enhance sulfur fugacity, as suggested by enstatite chondrites? Desch will supervise Graduate Student 2, assisted by Unterborn, to use the ArCCoS code to generate lookup tables of mineral condensation, simulate the vaporization and condensation of forsterite and CAI-forming minerals, and incorporate these into our disk evolution code in Years 1-2. Graduate Student 2 will lead a paper calculating the extent of Mg/Si fractionation at a silicate snow line across a range of disk models, to be submitted in Year 2. They will calculate the extent to which solids/gas ratios are enhanced at a CAI snow line and compare predictions based on meteoritic oxygen isotopic data, and submit a paper on results in Year 3. They will incorporate sulfur in the code, starting with a limited chemical network (H₂S vapor and FeS solid) and expanding to other sulfur species as needed, in Year 4. They will calculate the extent of variations in S/Si ratios at the S condensation front and assess whether enstatite chondrites formed in a region of enhanced sulfur fugacity. Desch will lead a paper to be submitted in Year 4. Graduate Student 2 will release all codes on GitHub in Year 4.
                        
                        Task 2b. Fractionations Due to Dynamics of Pebbles (Desch, Jackson, Nittler)
                        How do the dynamics of pebbles affect the compositions of planets?
                        There is growing recognition (e.g., Ormel, 2017) that solids were accreted in the form of 'pebbles' (particles with Stokes numbers St = ΩK t_stop ~ 10⁻⁴–10⁰, where ΩK is the orbital frequency and t_stop is the aerodynamic stopping time, proportional to particle size) that were aerodynamically partially decoupled from the gas. Such particles are slowed by gas drag instead of speeding past planets and are very effectively accreted by planetary embryos via 'pebble accretion' (Lambrechts & Johansen, 2012). Particles with St and size that are efficiently accreted by planetary embryos will also radially drift through disks on < 10⁶ yr timescales (Lambrechts & Johansen, 2014). As volatile-rich pebbles, akin to carbonaceous chondrites, radially drift inward from the outer disk, they may deliver large excesses of H₂O, C, etc., to the innermost few AU, where terrestrial planets form.
                        
                        Radial fluxes of CAIs have been demonstrated to decrease Ca, Al, Ti/Si ratios in the Sun's inner disk by tens of percent (Desch et al., 2018). Excess H₂O delivered to the inner disk by radial fluxes of carbonaceous pebbles could lead to excesses of water ice outside a snow line at T ≈ 170 K even larger than modeled in Task 2a. Excess C could combust to CO irreversibly at the T ≈ 500 K 'soot line' (Kress et al., 2010; Li et al., 2021), over time increasing the C/O ratio of the gas. Typical models posit ~300 M⊕ of carbonaceous pebbles flowed through the inner disk to feed the formation of the terrestrial planets (Lambrechts et al., 2019); combustion of C in this drifting carbonaceous material (typically ~3 wt% C) could add up to 20 M⊕ of CO to the inner disk, quintupling the expected initial amount and decreasing the oxygen fugacity (fO₂) by an order of magnitude. Carbonaceous pebble fluxes could yield very large (~3×) variations in planetary compositions.
                        
                        Despite their chemical importance, these fluxes in disks are unconstrained. Some models (Liu et al., 2018) predict large fluxes, but at late (>2 Myr) times; others (Kruijer et al., 2017; Desch et al., 2018) admit large fluxes in the solar nebula before a gap is opened in the disk by Jupiter ( greater than 0.9 Myr). Meteoritic data can be used to assess the carbonaceous pebble flux in our disk. One outcome is that CAIs should form at a CAI condensation front inside the carbon pebble flux but experience enhanced pebble fluxes before ~0.9 Myr.
                        
                        Desch will supervise the Graduate Student, assisted by Nittler, to test this idea. The Graduate Student will use our condensation front code to model the flux of CAIs and calculate the consequences of pebble-enhanced fO₂, and will compare predictions to Solar System meteoritic data. This effort will use the same disk code as Task 2a, but with different parameters, to simulate pebble accretion. Desch will work with Jackson to compare the code’s predictions with the compositions of planets in observed exoplanet systems, especially C/O ratios.
                        This work will lead to papers in Year 4 led by Desch, Jackson, and the Graduate Student. All codes will be posted on GitHub by Year 4.

                            <p>Task 3 delves into the intricate processes that define the composition of planetary cores and mantles, which can diverge significantly from their initial bulk compositions established in the protoplanetary disk. This task primarily explores the partitioning of crucial elements between a planet’s core and mantle, alongside the chemical changes that occur during core formation and giant impacts.

                                One of the key components of this task involves determining how elements such as magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) partition between planetary cores and mantles during differentiation across a range of pressure-temperature-redox (P-T-fO2) conditions. To achieve this, we will compile and calculate metal-silicate partition coefficients for these key elements, utilizing Density Functional Theory-based Molecular Dynamics (DFT-MD) tools, such as VASP, to model element partitioning at high pressures and temperatures. The development of a thermodynamic framework for coupled systems like Mg-Si-Fe-O under reducing conditions and high pressures will be central to this effort. The first year will focus on compiling literature data, installing the VASP code, and initiating calculations for Mg, Si, Fe, and O. In the subsequent years, the calculations will extend to include H, S, and P, leading to the publication of results and the creation of a usable database on EarthChem or NASA’s Planetary Data System (PDS).
                                
                                Another critical aspect of Task 3 is to model the compositional range of upper mantles following magma ocean crystallization. We will utilize and expand thermodynamic software, such as MELTerra and exoMELTS, to simulate the crystallization of magma oceans across a range of planetary sizes and compositions. This will involve modifying existing thermodynamic models to accurately extrapolate to higher pressures and non-terrestrial compositions. Throughout the five-year period, the development and release of MELTerra and exoMELTS models will be prioritized, with a focus on modeling small to super-Earth-sized planets and their magma oceans.
                                
                                Additionally, Task 3 aims to quantify the chemical changes that occur in planetary mantles and bulk-planet elemental abundances due to giant impacts during the early stages of planetary evolution. By investigating the effects of these impacts, especially in scenarios where impacts lead to the loss or alteration of specific mantle components, we aim to model how these events chemically alter planetary embryos. Over the five-year period, simulations will be conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the chemical alterations driven by giant impacts, particularly in the early evolutionary stages of planets.
                                
                                The expected outcomes of Task 3 include a comprehensive understanding of how key elements partition between planetary cores and mantles, the development of thermodynamic models and tools for simulating magma ocean crystallization and core formation, and quantitative insights into the chemical changes induced by giant impacts. These efforts will provide a foundational understanding of planetary interior processes and contribute valuable data to the broader scientific community.</p>

        <h2>Coming back to format later, task 4</h2>
        <p>Tasks 1 through 3 focus on establishing a probable range of exoplanet mantle compositions, also known as bulk silicate exoplanet (BSEP) compositions, based on the starting materials of stellar systems and the potential compositional shifts resulting from disk processes, planet formation, and planetary differentiation. The next step in our research is to quantify how elements are fractionated as materials migrate to the surface, through processes like outgassing, melt production, and silicate crust development, with a specific emphasis on key elements, particularly phosphorus (P). To do this, we will acquire new experimental data for compositions that are unlike those found on Earth, including melting curves and the solubility of phosphorus in partial BSEP melts. This new data will be used to update the exoMELTS/ENKI code. Additionally, we will model the thermal and geodynamic evolution of stagnant-lid rocky exoplanets to predict the rates at which key elements are emplaced on planet surfaces.

            Task 4a: Melt Production in Upper Mantles (Brugman, Till, Wolf)
            This task seeks to answer the question: What species are brought to the surface during the melting of upper mantles with likely BSEP compositions? Elements migrate to the surface from the upper mantle by being present in silicate melts that can be extruded onto the surface, where they eventually outgas or help form silicate crusts. Quantifying these processes requires experimental data on melting curves, residual solids, and the solubility of other key elements in those melts, across a range of conditions relevant to rocky exoplanets. This effort demands the acquisition of new experimental data for distinctly non-Earthlike compositions. The solubility of phosphorus, in particular, is not well understood for these non-Earthlike compositions, with most studies focusing on Solar System planets.
            
            A more profound petrological understanding of BSEP melting behavior, melt compositions, and elemental solubilities is essential for predicting the inventories of key elements on planet surfaces. Although models have been developed for exoplanet atmospheres and interior structures, these models generally assume planet compositions similar to Earth's. The lack of empirical data on the behaviors of silicate mantles and their melts when their compositions differ from Earth or other Solar System planets hinders our ability to account for varying exoplanet compositions. Exoplanetary mantles are likely to differ significantly from bulk silicate Earth (BSE) in terms of cation ratios, such as Fe/Si and Ca/Si. Geological processes that create magmas and igneous crusts may amplify differences between BSEP and BSE compositions.
            
            For example, plausible BSEP compositions only slightly different from Earth's could produce melts yielding a thick planetary crust that blocks chemical cycling or could increase the initial pressure of melting to the point where surficial magma oceans would form. Amplified differences in compositions could, in turn, greatly affect the solubility of key elements like carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus in BSEP upper mantle melts, with significant implications for the use of oxygen as a biosignature.
            
            Co-I Brugman will lead efforts to acquire experimental data to empirically determine melting curves, residual solids, and phosphorus solubility in melts across the range of likely BSEP compositions. Experimental petrology has successfully provided insights into redox conditions, degrees of differentiation, melt compositions, solidi, magma sources, and cooling rates for Solar System planets and moons. We will use similar approaches and conduct approximately 30 piston cylinder experiments per year in the EPIC lab at ASU. These experiments will determine likely mantle mineralogies, melting curves, magma and crust compositions, and phosphorus solubility across a range of BSEP compositions that differ significantly from near-BSE compositions previously studied.
            
            Co-Is Brugman, Till, and a postdoctoral researcher will determine the range of relevant elemental compositions, pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacity, and will design and conduct the experiments with the help of undergraduate researchers. The experiments will be conducted at pressures of approximately 0.8 to 3.5 GPa and temperatures ranging from 800 to 1700°C, mimicking conditions in the upper mantles of Mars- to super-Earth-sized rocky silicate bodies. The BSEP composition 'HEX2' will be used for the first set of experiments. This composition is phosphorus-free, providing a baseline for phosphorus solubility experiments. By adding phosphorus to this composition, we can assess its impact on the melting curve and investigate phosphorus solubility in a BSEP melt.
            
            In selecting starting compositions for subsequent experiments, we will be informed by the results of Tasks 3 and 4b and the outcomes of the workshop in Task 5. We will emphasize key variables, such as Fe/Si, Ca/Si, and Al/Si, that are critical for constraining phase boundaries in predictive models. We will also vary the P/Si and Ca/Si ratios of our starting compositions. Mantle redox state strongly affects the resulting magma compositions, their compositional evolution to planetary crusts, and volcanic outgassing. We will use state-of-the-art methods to control experimental redox in the range of redox expected for exoplanet near-surface solid-melt equilibria. Experiments will be buffered following established methods.
            
            Co-I Wolf will lead efforts to incorporate these experimental data into ENKI’s self-consistent thermodynamic exoMELTS model and revise calibrations as needed to capture these new thermochemical constraints on exotic exoplanetary compositions. We will benchmark new calibrations of exoMELTS for exoplanet magma-solid equilibria, key element solubilities, and a viscosity parameterization. Co-I Wolf will also use this model within the ENKI code MagmaForge to predict the evolutionary paths of partially melting exomantles, evolving their compositions through fractional crystallization, and solidifying into a final exoplanetary crust.
            
            The postdoctoral researcher, supervised by Brugman and Till, will compile literature data for solubilities of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in the first year. In years 1-3, the postdoc and Brugman will carry out piston cylinder partial melting experiments to determine phosphorus solubility. Starting in the first year, Brugman, Till, the postdoc, and undergraduate researchers will use these results to determine the appropriate range of silicate compositions and P-T-fO2 to be used in the next round of experiments. The experiments in year 3 will use compositions informed by modeling results of Tasks 3 and 4b. As a contingency, we will explore an under-explored region of BSEP parameter space. The postdoc will lead the publication of compiled BSEP melting curves and magma and crust compositions in year 3. Brugman will lead a paper on the empirical solubility of phosphorus in a range of silicate melts, to be submitted in year 5. Brugman will also assist Wolf, who will incorporate the data into ENKI in years 2 and 4.
            
            Task 4b: Production of Crusts and Atmospheres Over Time (Foley, Wolf)
            This task addresses the question: How do interior processes change the distribution of elements between rocky planets' mantles and surfaces over time? After a planet’s initial element distribution is set by processes such as planet formation, differentiation, magma ocean crystallization, and giant impacts, and its upper mantle forms, the final step is the redistribution of elements between the surface and the interior by volcanism, crust formation, ingassing, and outgassing during the planet’s long-term geologic evolution. These processes alter the abundances of key elements on a planet’s surface, including crustal rock, oceans, and atmospheres, and drive geochemical cycles.
            
            These processes have already concentrated elements, such as calcium, aluminum, and especially sodium and potassium, in Earth’s crustal rocks. The surface inventories of key volatile elements that make up Earth’s oceans and atmosphere, such as water, nitrogen, carbon, and bioessential phosphorus and sulfur, have been concentrated by past activity. For example, phosphorus has a surface abundance today that is approximately five times greater than its mantle abundance. Not only are the surface inventories of elements important, but also the rates at which they are brought to the surface, which are critical for geochemical cycles. For instance, the rate at which phosphorus is brought up from the interior sets the net oxygen production rate of Earth’s biosphere.
            
            A major uncertainty in such models is the tectonic mode of rocky planet evolution—whether they have plate tectonics like Earth, stagnant lids like Mars, or fall somewhere between these two end-members. Although tectonic mode impacts all aspects of a planet’s geophysical evolution, including rates and styles of in- and out-gassing and crust formation over time, there is no clear way to constrain it on rocky exoplanets. We will therefore consider stagnant-lid tectonics in our modeling as a starting point and a conservative baseline, as stagnant-lid convection likely leads to shorter-lived and less-active surface-interior cycling over time.
            
            Previous work has explored some aspects of element redistribution for stagnant-lid exoplanets, including rates of volatile cycling over time and the implications for habitability and crust formation. However, the influence of bulk planet composition has only been explored in limited samples, and no study has yet carefully tracked the partitioning of phosphorus and other key elements to the surface through crust formation, particularly for planets with non-Earthlike compositions. Moreover, whether felsic crusts, which on Earth are enriched in phosphorus, can form on such exoplanets has not been studied, despite evidence that felsic crust could have formed via stagnant-lid tectonics on the early Earth.
            
            Unterborn et al. (2022) developed a framework for modeling minimum lifetimes of volcanism and element recycling for stagnant-lid planets, using observationally constrained budgets for potassium-40, uranium, and thorium. We will extend this work</p>

        <h2>coming back to format later, task 5</h2>
        <p>Task 5 plays a crucial role in synthesizing and contextualizing the findings from previous tasks to develop a comprehensive understanding of rocky exoplanet compositions. The goal is to identify and characterize the plausible range of compositions for exoplanet near-surfaces and mantles, focusing on how these compositions impact climate, habitability, and biosignatures. This task is essential for advancing our knowledge of exoplanetary geology and its implications for habitability and biosignature detection.

            Task 5a: Identifying and Characterizing Elemental Abundance Ranges
            
            Task 5a is dedicated to identifying the ranges of elemental abundances that are likely for rocky exoplanets. This involves:
            
            Assessment of Elemental Abundance Ranges: The task begins with a comprehensive review of known exoplanetary compositions, focusing on the elemental abundances that could be present in rocky exoplanets. This includes analyzing data from observational missions, theoretical models, and laboratory experiments. The goal is to determine which elemental compositions are most likely and which have significant implications for planetary geology and habitability.
            
            Determining Impactful Variations: Once the ranges of elemental abundances are identified, the next step is to determine which variations are most impactful. For instance, variations in the abundance of water or different rock-forming minerals can significantly influence a planet’s geochemical cycles, surface conditions, and potential for habitability. The task involves modeling how these variations affect planetary processes and assessing their implications for climate stability and biosignature detection.
            
            Community Engagement: Engaging with the broader scientific community is crucial for refining these estimates. This involves consulting with experts in planetary science, geochemistry, and astrophysics to gather insights and build consensus on the most meaningful compositional variations. By incorporating diverse perspectives, the task aims to ensure that the identified ranges are realistic and scientifically relevant.
            
            Task 5b: Coordination and Communication
            
            Task 5b focuses on fostering effective coordination and communication within the NExSS (Nexus for Exoplanet System Science) network. This component involves:
            
            Building Intellectual Trust: The task emphasizes the importance of developing intellectual trust among team members and the broader scientific community. This involves regular interactions, sharing of findings, and collaborative problem-solving. The goal is to create a collaborative environment where researchers can freely exchange ideas and build on each other’s work.
            
            Establishing a Shared Language: To facilitate effective communication across disciplines, Task 5b aims to develop a shared language for discussing exoplanet compositions and their implications. This involves creating standardized terminology and frameworks that can be used by researchers from different fields, ensuring that discussions are clear and productive.
            
            Organizing Workshops and Meetings: The task includes organizing workshops and meetings to promote collaboration and dissemination of results. The first workshop, planned for Year 2, will focus on exploring how compositionally different a planet can be from Earth while still maintaining Earth-like geochemical cycles. This workshop will help establish a community consensus on what constitutes significant compositional variations.
            
            Presenting Results and Reassessing Consensus: The second workshop, scheduled for Year 5, will present the results of the TREC (Tracing Rocky Exoplanet Compositions) project. This workshop will communicate the findings to the broader NExSS community and reassess the consensus on meaningful compositional ranges. It will also include training in best practices for transdisciplinary science, leveraging new online technologies for education and collaboration.
            
            Workshops and Training
            
            The workshops proposed under Task 5 are pivotal for achieving the task’s objectives. They provide opportunities for:
            
            Provoking Thought: The first workshop aims to provoke thought on how compositional variations impact planetary systems. By discussing extreme cases and theoretical models, the workshop will help define the boundaries of what is considered Earth-like versus non-Earth-like in terms of composition.
            
            Communicating Results: The second workshop will focus on communicating the results of the TREC project, sharing insights with the broader scientific community, and discussing the implications for future research. This workshop will also address any gaps or emerging questions and refine the consensus on compositional variations.
            
            Training and Collaboration: Both workshops will include sessions on best practices for transdisciplinary science, emphasizing the importance of integrating knowledge from different fields. Training will cover new online technologies and methodologies for effective collaboration and education.
            
            Overall Objectives
            
            Task 5 aims to bridge the gap between astrophysics, geosciences, and biology by:
            
            Promoting Interdisciplinary Research: By integrating insights from various scientific disciplines, Task 5 seeks to advance our understanding of exoplanetary compositions and their implications for habitability and biosignature detection.
            
            Enhancing Communication: The task focuses on developing effective communication strategies and fostering collaboration among researchers. This includes creating a shared language, organizing workshops, and leveraging new technologies for research and education.
            
            Building Consensus: Task 5 aims to build a consensus on the range of compositional variations that are significant for exoplanetary science. This involves engaging with the scientific community, discussing findings, and refining estimates based on feedback and new data.
            
            In summary, Task 5 is essential for advancing the field of exoplanetary science by synthesizing findings, promoting interdisciplinary research, and fostering effective communication and collaboration within the scientific community.</p>

            Schedule for Data Archiving and Sharing
            Data will be archived permanently and made accessible following publication or within two years. The access guidelines aim to protect the research contributions of the team, especially early-career scientists, while ensuring open access. Publications will be presented at scientific meetings, submitted to peer-reviewed journals, and deposited in NASA's PubSpace. Open-access journals and arXiv.org will be utilized where possible. Data and codes will be stored on university servers with redundant backups and made available upon request.
            
            Intended Repositories and Public Access
            Codes and Model Output: Archived in public GitHub repositories and Zenodo, which provides a DOI for citable datasets. Large raw datasets will be shared through supplementary materials with publications.
            Planetary, Petrologic, and Geochemical Data: Deposited in AstroMat and NASA PDS.
            Experimental Products: Registered with EarthChem's Library for Experimental Phase Relations (LEPR) and stored at ASU for ten years.
            Web-hosted Database: The Database of Databases will provide access to all codes and data, adopting the GNU General Public License for reuse.
            Plan for Long-Term Preservation
            The data archive aims for perpetual maintenance. Publications will be deposited on PubSpace and included as supplementary materials. Data will also be archived in the ASU Libraries Digital Repository (LDR), which ensures long-term preservation, stability, and accessibility. The LDR adheres to best practices for digital preservation and provides persistent identifiers for consistent access.
            
            Software Archiving Plan
            Software will be archived with "readme" files in public repositories like GitHub, Zenodo, PDS, AstroMat, and LEPR. It will also be maintained on university servers, with Jupyter notebooks or code included in publications for reproducibility. ENKI output will be available on its dedicated portal.
            
            Samples Archiving Plan
            Experimental mineral products will be archived in the ASU EPIC lab and made available upon request.
            
            Roles and Responsibilities
            Co-I Unterborn will oversee data management, ensuring timely collection, storage, and processing of data. Investigators and their students will format and upload data to appropriate repositories, with compliance confirmed through annual reporting.
            
            This comprehensive plan ensures that all data and samples generated by the TREC project are effectively managed, preserved, and made accessible to the scientific community and the public.
